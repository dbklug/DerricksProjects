      <p class="bio">My journey has been an exciting one and a fun one. When I was in my mid-twenties I decided to go

      back to school full time. I chose to go into computer science having never coded anything before. Being behind the

      curve in the computer science community, I made up ground quickly, excelling in my classes and learning the things I

      need to know that will make me valuable to a company. <br><br> Now, years after having begun my journey, I'm excited

      to contribute to the world what I've learned and make an impact in the lives and people and business that thrive on

      cutting edge technology.</p>

      <p class="church">I attend Metro Detroit Christian Church in West Bloomfield. I have been attending there since 2011

      and am involved on the Audio/Video Team and the Worship Band.<br><br>AV Team responsibilities running the sound board,

      mic placement and levels, support worship band and pastoral needs, and more.<br><br>On the Worship Band I play drums,

      electric guitar and bass guitar.</p>

      <p class="music">My first instrument was Trombone in 5th grade but I didn't take to it. It wasn't until high school

      that I became passionate about music and bought my first drum set and took up drums. I spent all 4 years of high

      school developing a musical mind and playing.<br><br>After high school my parents bought me an Esteban guitar and

      a video that taught me my first 3 chords; after that I was off. Years later I was need as a bassist in a band, so

      I quickly picked that up. In college I took a piano class and learned the basics I needed to continue teaching myself.</p>

      <p class="sports">My favorite sports to play are baseball, basketball, soccer, table tennis, volleyball, well... just

      about anything really.<br><br>When I was young I'd play street hockey with the neighbors and I loved to play goalie.

      I skateboarded most of high school and ran track and cross country.<br><br>I stay fit by eating healthy and exercising.

      I love free weights, sprinting, and long runs.</p>
